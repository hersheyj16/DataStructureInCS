Overview
 this repositary is about datastructure.
 

If you are not familiar with a linked list, you might want to read the Wikipedia page about it, but we'll also start with a brief introduction.

Linked data structures
A data structure is "linked" if it is made up of objects, often called "nodes", that contain references to other nodes. In a linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node in the list. Other linked structures include trees and graphs, in which nodes can contain references to more than one other node.

A linked list is used to store a sequence of elements, so each node contains a reference to an element, or sometimes to a collection of elements. The element part of the node is sometimes called "cargo", so you can think of nodes as rail cars, where each car contains cargo and the cars are connected together.
